### Basic Structure of Computers

| Computer Types                      | Description |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Embedded Computers**             | - Integrated into a larger device or system for monitoring and control of physical processes.<br> - Used for specific purposes, e.g., industrial automation, appliances, telecommunication, and vehicles. |
| **Personal Computers (PCs)**       | - Widespread use in homes, education, and offices.<br> - Support various applications: computation, document preparation, design, entertainment, communication, and internet browsing.<br><br> **Classifications:** Desktop, Workstation, Portable/Notebook. |
| **Servers and Enterprise Systems** | - Large computers shared by many users over networks.<br> - Host large databases and provide information processing for organizations.                                                          |
| **Supercomputers and Grid Computers** | - Offer highest performance, used in demanding computations (e.g., weather forecasting, engineering, science).<br> - Expensive and large.<br> - Grid computers are cost-effective, using distributed networked PCs and storage. |
| **Cloud Computing**                | - Users access distributed computing and storage resources via the internet.<br> - Operated as a utility, charging on a pay-as-you-use basis.                                                  |
