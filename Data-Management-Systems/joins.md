All the joins, what they mean, and how to remember them

In SQL, there are several types of joins, each serving a specific purpose depending on the desired result. Here's an overview of each join type with a mnemonic to help remember its use:

1. **INNER JOIN**:
   - **Use**: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables.
   - **Mnemonic**: Think of the word "intersection" in a Venn diagram—INNER JOIN gets you just the overlapping part.

2. **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**:
   - **Use**: Selects all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the right side.
   - **Mnemonic**: Think "Left = Loaded" to remember that all from the left table are loaded into the results.

3. **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN**:
   - **Use**: Selects all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the left side.
   - **Mnemonic**: Think "Right = Reserved" to remember that all from the right table are reserved in the results.

4. **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**:
   - **Use**: Selects all records when there is a match in either left or right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL for the unmatched side.
   - **Mnemonic**: Think of "Full = Full House" indicating that every record from both tables makes it to the results, with placeholders (NULLs) where necessary.

5. **CROSS JOIN**:
   - **Use**: Produces a Cartesian product of the two tables—i.e., each row of the first table is combined with all rows from the second table.
   - **Mnemonic**: Think "Cross = Combination" as it combines everything across both tables without any matching condition.

6. **SELF JOIN**:
   - **Use**: A regular join, but the table is joined with itself. It’s useful when there are relationships within the same table.
   - **Mnemonic**: "Self = Mirror" to remember that the table is being mirrored to join with itself.

7. **NATURAL JOIN**:
   - **Use**: Automatically joins tables based on columns with the same names and compatible data types. It's generally not recommended because the join criteria are implicit, which can lead to unexpected results.
   - **Mnemonic**: Think "Natural = Automatic" since it automatically finds commonality to join on.

Remembering the type of join can indeed be challenging, but these mnemonics tie the purpose of the join to a visual or conceptual cue that can make it easier to recall what each join does when you're writing or reading SQL queries.

Certainly! Here are examples for each type of join using two hypothetical tables, `employees` and `departments`, where each employee is assigned to one department and each department may have zero or more employees:

### 1. INNER JOIN
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
This query retrieves the name of the employees and their respective department names, but only for employees who are assigned to a department.

### 2. LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
This includes all employees, even if they are not assigned to any department. Those without a department will have `NULL` in the `department_name` field.

### 3. RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
This query includes all departments, even those without any employees. Employees not assigned to any of the departments in the result set will have `NULL` values for their names.

### 4. FULL (OUTER) JOIN
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
This returns all records when there is a match in the `employees` or `departments` table. If there is no match, the result is `NULL` on the side of the table without a match.

### 5. CROSS JOIN
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```
This produces the Cartesian product of both tables, pairing each employee with every department, regardless of whether they are associated or not.

### 6. SELF JOIN
Assuming `employees` has a column `manager_id` that references another employee:
```sql
SELECT e1.name AS Employee, e2.name AS Manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```
This query retrieves each employee's name along with their manager's name.

### 7. NATURAL JOIN
```sql
-- Assuming both tables have exactly one column in common, for example, 'department_id'
SELECT *
FROM employees
NATURAL JOIN departments;
```
This will join the `employees` and `departments` tables on the column `department_id` without explicitly specifying the `ON` condition. The `NATURAL JOIN` only works when both tables have one or more columns with the same name and compatible types, and it automatically uses these as join conditions. However, due to its implicit nature, it's often avoided in practice to prevent unexpected results.

Please note that the actual structure of your `employees` and `departments` tables may require different join conditions or column names. The examples assume common column names for simplicity.
